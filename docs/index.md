# Digital Dice

You want to have more flair when playing board games with family or friends?
Why not use electronic dice? With electronic dice you can keep the statistics or remember what you threw last time. This way you wont forget what the odds are leaning too. You can use it to settle arguments of what happend before with the throw history.

The Dice itself will be a microcontroller with a button, LCD screen to display the thrown number and a battery to make it wireless and easy to carry it around. 

There will be a website where you can throw dice, see history, and or even statistics to keep you up to date on the changes the dice lives through. There will be an admin page to see and manage all the data, and a sweet user friendly front-end where you can see the statics, device data, and the history of throws.

To enable the electronic dice to work everywhere, we took the time to create an API where the microcontroller can talk to the website and keep track of your offline gaming statistics.
